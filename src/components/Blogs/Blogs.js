                <h1>Istanbul</h1>
                <p>Istanbul is home to some famous historical sites — the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Grand Bazaar, and Spice Market. They are stunning, important historical sites to see and experience. But the city also offers lots of fun things to do that have fewer crowds and are a bit off the beaten path.

                    As important as it is to visit culturally significant historical sites (after all, there’s nothing wrong with being a tourist) there is so much more to every destination than just the main tourist bullet points.

                    Of course, you shouldn’t miss Istanbul’s major sites. But once you’ve done them, there are plenty of offbeat things to see and do here. Here are my favorites to help you get started and make the most out of your trip</p>

                <h1>Explore The Asian Side</h1>
                <p>Istanbul is the only city in the world to straddle two continents; it spans from Europe to Asia. The Asian side (also called the Anatolian side) is separated from the European side by the Bosphorus Strait. You can take a bus over the famous Bosphorus Bridge, or you can ride over on a ferry. The city’s main tourist sites are on the European side, but if you’ve never been to Asia, it’s fun to cross over so you can say you’ve been there. If you’re interested in shopping, check out the popular markets in Kadiköy.

                    Other worthy activities include touring the Beylerbeyi Palace, riding up to the top of Çamlica Hill for incredible views of the city, and strolling along Bagdat Caddesi to explore the many restaurants, cafés, and shops.</p>

                <h1>Visit a Real Hammam</h1>
                <p>Many of the swanky hotels in Istanbul have hammams, otherwise known as Turkish baths, but they usually aren’t the real deal. They’re made for Westerners looking for a cushy and modest experience. Real hammams have been a Turkish tradition for thousands of years, and they have served as both a place to cleanse and to socialize. Most hammams are separated by gender, and women generally go topless. You transition through several different rooms of different temperatures, one being a hot steam room much like a sauna. You can opt to pay an attendant to give you a thorough scrub-down — it’s rough but invigorating! Çemberlitai Hamami is a good option for visitors looking to give the experience a try; another popular one is Cagaloglu. Both are located in the Old Town.</p>
